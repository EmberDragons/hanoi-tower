This is a hanoi tower simulation made with python and tkinter.
What is it?
 - hanoi tower solver and simulation
 - up to 6 rings
 - you can move them by hand
 - see them move in the most optimised way
How it works?
The algorithme behind the towers' movement is generated thanks to recursivity. Basically:
1. is a recursivity to telling the smaller rings where not to go
2. then we move the n - ring (the one we are at)
3. second recursivity so that the rings can go back to the n - ring
Also the code for this algorithm is in moveset.py

Hope you like it!
